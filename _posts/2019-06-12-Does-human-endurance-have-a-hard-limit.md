Humans love to test their limits. Some people run marathons, race triathlons, or climb the world’s highest peaks. All of these endeavors are challenging, but can we quantitatively compare how each undertaking pushes the human body? Join us this week as Charlie dives into new research that seeks to determine a ‘hard limit’ on human energy expenditure, both in relatively short duration tasks like running a marathon as well as long duration tasks like running 6 marathons a week for 20 weeks or even being pregnant!

Here's a copy of the plot showing the how sustained metabolic rate changes with respect to event duration:![ratechange](http://paperboyspodcast.com/assets/img/pageimg/metabolicrate.PNG "Sustained Metabolic Rate vs. Event Duration")
