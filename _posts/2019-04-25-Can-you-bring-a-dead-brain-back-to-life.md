Once an animal dies, there isn't much hope of bringing it back to life - especially when that animal is a slaughtered pig. There has been past research into brain activity after death, but the brain has to be essentially destroyed first. Now, scientists have developed a technique for continuing the pig's brain function for many hours after death using a very complicated pump and well-engineered brain fluid. The best part? The brain is fully intact! On this week's episode, James dives into a paper talking about this technique and the crazy implications it could have for future humans.
