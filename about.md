## Why *Paper Boys*?
Do you ever read science news and wonder, "There's got to be more to this research?"  On *Paper Boys*, we unravel the actual journal papers behind these latest headlines in science news, breaking down complicated topics and calling out misinformation in the media. There are lots of excellent science podcasts and news sources, but *Paper Boys* uniquely offers two scientists' perspectives on the actual research behind the headlines.

I'm **Charlie**, a PhD student studying plasma physics and aerospace engineering. My research is aimed at using plasma as a propellant in rockets and as a tool for slowing satellites down when travelling
to other planets. A true space nerd, I got into this field out a passion for exploring the solar system (my favorite rover is Curiosity, obviously). I still want to be an astronaut when I grow up.

I'm **James**. I'm a PhD student in electrical engineering with a concentration in wireless communication systems and neural engineering. I'm passionate about research that expands our understanding of the universe and our place within it. My focus is on new architectures for embedded wireless electronics to enable smaller, lighter, and lower power sensor systems for extreme environments like outer space and the brain. Favorite spacecraft? Voyager I and II (call me old fashioned).
